# Followed By - For Github

ever visit someone’s @github profile and wonder — hmm, do we know each other? well here’s an easy fix to a self manifested problem ✨ getfollowedby.xyz  ✨ (working url soon)

followed by uses GitHub’s public API to fetch mutual followers for every profile you visit, straight to the profile page!

## 🤩 want to use followed by?
followed will soon be available on the chrome and firefox stores. for folks on safari, dev is under progress; for now, check out how to unpack extensions [here](https://youtu.be/oswjtLwCUqg)

## 🛠 want to install followed by, locally?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parzuko/followedby.git
cd followedby
```
from here you can use the same unpacking process for extension!

## 🫡 plans for the future?
this project was made purely out of fun, to take my mind off things. feel free to contribute by creating issues/PRs and i will review them when i get the time. potential future features, might include `follows you` badges, safari support and migrating to typescript.

made for fun, and maybe for myself ✌️
