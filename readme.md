# Followed By - For GitHub

ever visit someone’s GitHub profile and wonder — hmm, do we know each other? well here’s an easy fix to traverse the builders social graph:  ✨ [getfollowedby.xyz](https://getfollowedby.xyz) ✨

`followedby` uses GitHub’s public API to fetch mutual followers for every profile you visit, straight to the profile page!

### 🤔 it’s cool, but is it any good?

1. get set build: no package installs, `followedby` has 0 runtime dependancies
2. your data is yours: no logging or storage on any server, because there ain’t any!
3. clean and concise: built only using vanilla JS and the web API
4. feels like it belongs: all UI config is _inspired_ from GitHub Sponsors, making followed by look like a first party product!

## 🤩 want to use followed by?
followed by is available on the [chrome](https://getfollowedby.xyz/download/chrome) and [firefox](https://getfollowedby.xyz/download/firefox) stores. for folks on safari, dev is under progress; for now, check out how to unpack extensions [here](https://youtu.be/oswjtLwCUqg)

## 🛠 want to install followed by, locally?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parzuko/followedby.git
cd followedby
```
from here you can use the same unpacking process for extension!

## 🫡 plans for the future?
this project was made purely out of fun, to take my mind off things and just build! feel free to contribute by creating issues/PRs and i will review them when i get the time. potential future features, might include `follows you` badges, safari support and migrating to typescript.

made for fun, and maybe for myself ✌️
